Description
We first let the FSL FAST algorithm generate MRI images that are corrected for
bias fields. (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FAST)
After this step, we cut the brain into 8x8x8 cubes, so in total 512 cubes. For
each of these cubes we generated a histogram, all these histograms
concatenated build the feature vector for our algorithm.

We used a random forest classifier to solve our multi-label classification
problem.
