Description
We first cut off some of the outer space around the brain. Then we devided the
brain into 3x3x3 blocks and generated a histogram with 50 bins over the range
[1,4001]. We put each histogram of the blocks after another to receive a single
vector per brain.
After the feature selection we trained a RBF support vector classifier on all the
training examples to gain the estimator. We did a gridsearch for the best
parameters C and gamma. This yielded our results.
